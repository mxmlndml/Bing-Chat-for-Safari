If you want to use Bing Chat in Safari you are prompted to download Microsoft Edge in order to proceed. This userscript replaces this prompt with a guide on how to replace your User Agent string. If you follow the steps you are able to use Bing Chat in Safari without downloading Microsoft Edge.

**⚠️  You still need a Microsoft Account to use Bing Chat**

## How to
1. Make sure you have an extension installed that allows you to add userscripts to Safari. Download the userscript and add it to your extension. 
2. Visit Bing and log into your Microsoft account.
3. Press the Chat link in the header. This should open the popup that once instructed you to download Microsoft Edge, but now it shows instructions how to use Bing Chat in Safari. Follow these steps.
4. The page reloads and shows the Bing Chat prompt.

**⚠️  If you open Bing Chat in a different tab you have to change the User Agent again**
